    > v -n20 -p5

`-n` and `-p` are specifing options.
You can omit it as you like then each commad uses default value.

    > v
    # => `video -n10 -p3`
    > v -n20
    # => `video -n20 -p3`
    > v -p5
    # => `video -n20 -p5`

And also, you can use `-l, --latest`, `-h, --hours`, `-d, --days` options to find reports by the specific period.

    > all -l
    > lives -h 1

### Configuration

You can configure default `request_num` and `limit_page` by adding `~/.nicorepo.yaml` if you want.
